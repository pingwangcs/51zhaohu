of all or any portion of our Platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2.2&nbsp;<b>Password and Security.</b>&nbsp;When you

<p class='MsoNormal zhaohu-policy-statement-header'><b>3. Fees and Payments</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.1&nbsp;<b>General.</b>&nbsp;Access to our websites and use
of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various
premium features and services that we offer, and we will notify you of those
charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a
fee. We may, in our sole discretion, and by notifying you on our website,
change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other
features and services, and we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or
change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or
the type of fees) we charge at any time. If we introduce a new service or
charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service
at the launch of the service or start of charging a new fee. If we notify you
of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all
fees and charges specified and all applicable taxes for your continued use of
the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you
incur resulting from being billed by us in accordance with these Terms of
Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.2&nbsp;<b>Fees Assessed by Organizers; Payments to
Organizers.</b>&nbsp;Some Organizers may require or request fees for membership
in a Group, or for attendance at Zhaohu Group events. Individual Zhaohu Group
membership fees, Zhaohu Meeting or other event fees are at the discretion of
each Organizer, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount
frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You
may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular
Organizers. Fees assessed by Organizers are remitted to the Organizer and not
to 51Zhaohu. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another
payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer,
you acknowledge that 51Zhaohu does not control the transaction, and that you
bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you
make to any Organizer are subject to that Organizer's policies and applicable
law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer is in error, you must contact
the Organizer to seek resolution. You should use common sense and be careful in
deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer. Organizers have full
discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their Zhaohu
Groups or Alliances. We cannot ensure that an Organizer is legitimate and truthful,
that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with
how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or
participation in promotions of Zhaohu Groups, including payment and related
services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations
associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable
Organizer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.3&nbsp;<b>Group Sponsorships.</b>&nbsp; We may offer your Zhaohu
Group third party sponsorship opportunities (&quot;Sponsorships&quot;). To accept
a Sponsorship offer and receive any applicable Sponsorship payments, the
Organizer must register for an Amazon.com Payments merchant account within 90
days of the Sponsorship offer. If an Organizer does not register for an
Amazon.com Payments merchant account within 90 days of the Sponsorship offer,
the Organizer and applicable Zhaohu Group forfeit all right to any payment
based upon that offer. All sponsorships are subject to change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3.4&nbsp;<b>Consent to Disclosure.</b>&nbsp;You acknowledge
and agree that 51Zhaohu may disclose Your Information (as defined in Section 4)
if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is
reasonably necessary to:(a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court
order or legal process served on us or our website, (b) enforce this Agreement,
(c) respond to claims that Your Information violates the rights of third
parties; (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of 51Zhaohu, its
employees, users and the public; or (e) enable the transfer or sale to another
entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of
business to which this Agreement relates, or upon any other corporate
reorganization, subject to the promises made in this Agreement. We also may
disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government
officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in
connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,
or other activity that is illegal or that we believe may expose us or you to
legal liability.</p>

<p class='MsoNormal zhaohu-policy-statement-header'><b>13. Dispute Resolution</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.1&nbsp;<b>Process.</b>&nbsp;The parties will attempt in
good faith to resolve through negotiation any dispute, claim or controversy
arising out of or relating to this Agreement including the documents it
incorporates by reference, your use of our Platform, Your Information, your
violation of any law or the rights of a third party, or your participation in Zhaohu
Meetings (whether the dispute, claim or controversy is due to or arising out of
your transportation to or from, attendance at, or the actions of you or other
users at Zhaohu Meetings). In the event that the dispute, claim or controversy
is not resolved by these negotiations, the matter will be submitted to <a
name=\"OLE_LINK1\">Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.</a> (a.k.a.
&quot;JAMS&quot;), or its successor, for mediation pursuant to Section 13.3,
and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted
to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding arbitration pursuant to
Section 13.4. Nonetheless, legal action taken by 51Zhaohu to collect any fees
and/or recover damages for, or obtain an injunction relating to, our website
operations, intellectual property or our Platform, shall not be submitted to
mediation or arbitration except as otherwise agreed to in writing by 51Zhaohu.
In addition, either you or 51Zhaohu may seek any interim or preliminary relief
from a Court of competent jurisdiction in Seattle, Washington necessary to
protect the rights or property of you or 51Zhaohu pending the completion of
arbitration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.2&nbsp;<b>Negotiation.</b>&nbsp;Either party may initiate
negotiations by providing written notice in letter form to the other party,
setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The
recipient of such notice will respond in writing within fifteen (15) business
days with a statement of its position on and recommended solution to the
dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by this exchange of correspondence,
then representatives of each party with full settlement authority will meet in
person or otherwise at a mutually agreeable time and place within thirty (30)
business days of the date of the initial notice in order to exchange relevant
information and perspectives, and to attempt to resolve the dispute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.3&nbsp;<b>Mediation.</b>&nbsp;Either party may commence
mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for
mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested.
The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a
mediator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the mediation
proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in
good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers,
promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course
of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and
attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential,
privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any
arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence
that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible
or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation. Either party may
initiate arbitration with respect to the matters submitted to mediation by
filing a written demand for arbitration at any time following the initial
mediation session or forty-five (45) days after the date of filing the written
request for mediation, whichever occurs first. The mediation may continue after
the commencement of arbitration if the parties so desire. Unless otherwise
agreed by the parties, the mediator shall be disqualified from serving as
arbitrator in the case.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.4&nbsp;<b>Arbitration.</b>&nbsp;The parties agree that
any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to
this Agreement that are not resolved by their mutual agreement by negotiation
or mediation under Sections 13.2 and 13.3 shall be submitted to final and
binding arbitration before JAMS, or its successor, pursuant to the United
States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq. Either party may commence the
arbitration process called for in this Agreement by filing a written demand for
arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be
conducted in accordance with the provisions of JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration
Rules and Procedures in effect at the time of filing of the demand for
arbitration. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in
selecting an arbitrator from JAMS' panel of neutrals, and in scheduling the
arbitration proceedings. The parties covenant that they will participate in the
arbitration in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.5&nbsp;<b>Enforcement.</b>&nbsp;The provisions of
Sections 13.3 and 13.4 may be enforced by any Court of competent jurisdiction,
and the party seeking enforcement shall be entitled to an award of all costs,
fees and expenses, including attorney\'s fees, to be paid by the party against
whom enforcement is ordered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13.6&nbsp;<b>Notice; Waiver.</b>&nbsp;By agreeing to this
Agreement you have submitted to the judgments of, except as otherwise specified
in Section 13.1, all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or
relating to this Agreement decided by negotiation, neutral mediation and/or
neutral arbitration as provided in this Section 13, and you are giving up any
rights you might possess to have those matters litigated in a court or jury
